# Program: HIVE-Engine Auto Witness Monitor (HE-AWM)
# Description: Manages the sync of the node and the witness registration status/notifications
# Author: forykw
# Date: 2021/11/24
# v1.2.4

## Optimised for:
# Hive-Engine 1.7.0+

## Requirements
# Log name output from the hive-engine node (app.js)
NODE_APP_LOG="node_app.log"
# Name of the witness account signing blocks
WITNESS_NAME="atexoras.witness"
# Name of the PM2 process that started the node (app.js)
PM2_NODE_NAME="prod-hivengwit"

## State variables
# Represents the witness registered state (1-Registered, 2-Unregistered)
SIGNING_BLOCKS="0"
# Represents the intention to register (1-Registering, 2-Unregistering)
REGISTER="0"
# Represents the initial and previous assumed states of the node when this script starts (1-Down, 0-Running)
NODE_DOWN="1"
NODE_PREVIOUS_STATE=${NODE_DOWN}

# Timestamp format for script output
timestamp_format ()

        echo "[`date --iso-8601=seconds`] "
}

# Main loop

# Save last state of the node

# Validate if node is down

# If starting the node, wait a few seconds for log to change

# For the next two variables "BLOCKS_MISSING" and "TIMES_MISSING"
# (TODO) - Fix the cases when logrotate starts a new file and there are no messages
# (IMPROVE) - Find a way to not rely on tail and be lightweight in IO access
# (FIX) - Play with arrays and reduce the amount of queries to IO

# Adjust number of lines depending on log history messages
