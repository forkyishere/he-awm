# HIVE-Engine Auto Witness Monitor (HE-AWM)

This is a bash script to automate the Hive-Engine Witness node registration status and avoid missed blocks.

Still very early Alpha kind of stuff, so treat it accordantly.
Will get better over time.

## Disclaimer
This script needs to be (potentially) modified if the Hive-Engine code changes, therefore always double check the `Optimised for:` comment section inside the script.
The main focus is to allow a node to live without disrupting the network in case of problematic situations, hence it can unregister temporarily your witness or stop the node.
Until a new flag is added (for dry run) make due deliegence before executing this script.
Runnning this script will only take actions passively to what happens to your node log, in terms of node (un)registration and node stop/start status.

## `he_awm.sh`
Name of the executable bash script that runs on the same folder of the HIVE-Engine witness code.

## Configurables
Inside the script check the `Requirements` comment section and its variables. Adapting these to your node should be enought to get you going.

In addition, if you would like to customise the state of which the script starts, change the variables under the `State variables` comment section to other initial states.

## How to start
Review the script contents and modify at your leasure any initial status or thresholds. Then simply execute the script:
```
[your_hive_engine_witness_folder]> ./he_awm.sh
```

## How to stop
Ctrl+C or kill the pid from the script (use `ps -ef | grep he_awm.sh` to find it)

# Features
 - Blockchain sync detection via `node_app.log` output
 - Automatic register or unregister witness via stability of the node (blocks behind)
   1. Assumes 1 block behind as being acceptable as long there is no more than 4 repetitions (configurable) - aka recovers quickly
   2. If the chain is more than 1 block ahead, unregister
   3. Once we are again in sync with zero sync problems for a couple seconds, register
- Display messages when witness is scheduled for signing or signed a block
- Fork detection and node unregister+shutdown
- Node recovery on false fork alarm (depends on `antiForkBufferMaxSize` and scan frequency)
